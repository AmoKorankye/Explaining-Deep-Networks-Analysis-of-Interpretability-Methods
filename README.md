# Grad-CAM and SHAP Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementation of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Introduction

Model interpretability is crucial for understanding how deep learning models make decisions. This project implements two popular techniques:

- **Grad-CAM**: Visualizes important regions in an image that contributed to a specific classification decision.
- **SHAP**: Provides feature importance using game theory concepts to explain individual predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- shap
- Pillow
- OpenCV

## Installation

```bash
pip install torch tensorflow numpy matplotlib shap pillow opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `gradcam_and_SHAP_implementation.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook

## Notebook Breakdown

The `gradcam_and_SHAP_implementation.ipynb` notebook contains a comprehensive implementation with the following structure:

1. **Setup and Dependencies**
   - Installation of required packages
   - Import statements for libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, etc.)
   - Configuration settings for reproducibility

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Image loading using PIL or OpenCV
   - Preprocessing functions including resizing, normalization, and tensor conversion
   - Creation of sample image batch for analysis

3. **Model Loading**
   - Loading pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet, etc.) from PyTorch or TensorFlow
   - Setting model to evaluation mode
   - Configuring model layers for feature extraction

4. **Grad-CAM Implementation**
   - Registration of forward and backward hooks to capture feature maps
   - Target class selection mechanism (highest probability or user-defined)
   - Computing class activation maps using gradients and feature maps
   - Visualization code for heatmap overlay on original images
   - Example output interpretation and analysis

5. **SHAP Implementation**
   - Creation of background dataset from sample images
   - Setup of DeepExplainer or GradientExplainer based on model type
   - Computation of SHAP values for input images
   - Generation of SHAP visualizations (summary plots, force plots)
   - Pixel-wise attribution maps showing feature importance

6. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Side-by-side comparison of Grad-CAM and SHAP results
   - Quantitative metrics for evaluation (if applicable)
   - Discussion of strengths and limitations of each approach

Each section contains detailed comments and explanations to guide users through the implementation process and help them understand the underlying principles.

## Methodology

### Grad-CAM

The notebook implements Grad-CAM by:
1. Loading a pre-trained CNN model
2. Processing input images
3. Computing gradients of output with respect to feature maps
4. Generating heatmaps that highlight important regions for classification

### SHAP

The SHAP implementation:
1. Creates a background dataset for reference
2. Applies the SHAP explainer to the model
3. Generates visualizations showing feature importance
4. Provides both global and local explanations of model behavior

## Interpreting Results

- **Grad-CAM heatmaps**: Warmer colors (red/yellow) indicate regions that strongly influenced the model's decision
- **SHAP values**: Positive values (red) push predictions higher, while negative values (blue) push predictions lower
